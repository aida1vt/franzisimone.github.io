<h2>Bio</h2>
<p> I am a doctoral student in the School of Public & International Affairs and research assistant at the Global Forum on Resilience at Virginia Tech. My current research examines the political economy of trade and trade agreements. I work also on technological innovations and their impacts to political institutions. In particular, I am interested in the regulatory aspect of blockchain technology. I also writes and lecture about the co-evolution of capitalism and democracy, processes of democratization, the Swiss political system, Swiss education, and Swiss-US relations.</p>
