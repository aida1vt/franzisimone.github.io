<h2>Bio</h2>
I am a doctoral student in the School of Public & International Affairs and research assistant at the Global Forum on Resilience at Virginia Tech. My current research examines the political economy of trade, trade agreements, and technological innovations and their impacts in formal political institutions. I also writes about democracy and processes of democratization.
